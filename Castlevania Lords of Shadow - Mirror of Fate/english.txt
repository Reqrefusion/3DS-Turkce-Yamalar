cutscene_2_4_line9_1#Simon#My father came to this castle many years ago when I was but a child.
cutscene_2_4_line9_2#Simon#He came to destroy the evil that lives here. He never returned.

cutscene_3_4_line10_2#Dracula#I will not suffer that blood line to live any longer!
cutscene_3_4_line2#Alucard#Father.
cutscene_3_4_line3#Dracula#It's been a long time.
cutscene_3_4_line4#Alucard#It seems fate has given me a second chance.
cutscene_3_4_line5#Alucard#I have come to finish what I started.
cutscene_3_4_line6_1#Dracula#I know why you have come. I had hoped you would stand with me, son.
cutscene_3_4_line6_2#Dracula#Hoped that you would understand why I must destroy the brotherhood.
cutscene_3_4_line6_3#Dracula#Join me, in remaking this world.
cutscene_3_4_line7_1#Alucard#Join you? Look at me! You've made me a monster, Father!
cutscene_3_4_line7_2#Alucard#You've made me like you: a creature that thirsts for blood, filled with hatred.
cutscene_3_4_line7_3#Alucard#You should have let me die that night...
cutscene_3_4_line8_1#Dracula#No matter.
cutscene_3_4_line8_2#Dracula#It all ends now!
cutscene_3_4_line9#Alucard#Let him go. This is between me and you!
cutscene_3_5_line0#Alucard#This isn't how a vampire is supposed to die.
cutscene_3_5_line1#Simon#What do you mean?
cutscene_3_5_line2#Alucard#It wants the pendant you are wearing.
cutscene_3_5_line3#Simon#Not a chance! It was a gift from my father. It is all I have of him.
cutscene_3_5_line4_1#Alucard#Your father gave you that without knowing its true power.
cutscene_3_5_line4_2#Alucard#As long as you wear it, you will not be able to decide or act entirely for yourself.
cutscene_3_5_line4_3#Alucard#Your actions will be guided, manipulated.
cutscene_3_5_line4_4#Alucard#Do you think you are here entirely of your own free will?
cutscene_3_5_line4_5#Alucard#Let it go,  it doesn't belong to you.
cutscene_3_5_line5#Alucard#...just as it did not belong to your father.
cutscene_3_5_line6#Simon#Will you tell me now who you are?
cutscene_3_5_line7#Simon#Farewell.
cutscene_4_1_line0#Sypha#That's your father's, Simon. Please, leave it, it's not a toy.
cutscene_4_1_line1#Sypha#Why has the Brotherhood waited until now to tell you this?
cutscene_4_1_line2#Trevor#I don't know. I suspect they believed he would not return.
cutscene_4_1_line3_1#Trevor#It must be me, Sypha. It can be no other! You understand that, don't you?
cutscene_4_1_line3_2#Trevor#For the honour of my own family, I cannot live with this shame.
cutscene_4_1_line3_3#Trevor#I must protect you and Simon from this.
cutscene_4_1_line4#Trevor#I must avenge my mother.
cutscene_4_1_line5_1#Trevor#I have carried this small piece of mirror since I was a boy.
cutscene_4_1_line5_2#Trevor#It is said it comes from a magical mirror, capable of showing your past and true fate.
cutscene_4_1_line5_3#Trevor#Though it has never shown me anything, perhaps one day my son; it will reveal something of yours.
cutscene_4_1_line6_1#Trevor#Keep it and always carry it with you, Simon.
cutscene_4_1_line6_2#Trevor#Will you do that for me?
cutscene_4_1_line7_1#Trevor#If I have not returned by dawn, take the boy and leave this place far behind.
cutscene_4_1_line7_2#Trevor#Take to the forest but do not look for me.
cutscene_4_1_line8#Sypha#Come back to us, my love.
cutscene_4_2_line0#Lost_Soul#Welcome, Trevor. I've been expecting you.
cutscene_4_2_line1#Trevor#Who are you? How do you know my name?
cutscene_4_2_line2_1#Lost_Soul#I know all. I am here to make sure that everything happens tonight as it is supposed to happen.
cutscene_4_2_line2_2#Lost_Soul#I am here to guide you.
cutscene_4_2_line3#Trevor#Guide me? I don't need anyone to guide or direct me. Move aside.
cutscene_4_2_line4_1#Lost_Soul#As you wish... However, your fate has already been sealed and there is nothing you can do to change it.
cutscene_4_2_line4_2#Lost_Soul#I am sorry to say that you will not achieve your objective,
cutscene_4_2_line4_3#Lost_Soul#and your wife and your son will suffer the consequences of your failure.
cutscene_4_2_line5#Trevor#I will hear no more from you!
cutscene_4_4_line0#Trevor#Come out and face me!
cutscene_4_4_line1_1#Dracula#I was planning to pay a visit on the brotherhood.
cutscene_4_4_line1_2#Dracula#It was unnecessary to send someone "special" to meet me?
cutscene_4_4_line10#Trevor#I'll tell you her name...!
cutscene_4_4_line11#Trevor#Right before, I cut it into your heart!
cutscene_4_4_line2#Dracula#I say that because I see you hold one of Gandolfi's weapons in your hand.

Gabriel never knowing that he had a son by her.||Although Gabriel later defeated the dread Lords of Shadow, Gabriel fell into darkness as foretold... becoming... Dracula.|Now atop his colossal mountain fortress, he delivers his war upon the Brotherhood and mankind.||Trevor grew to manhood, oblivious of his true lineage and had a son of his own, Simon Belmont.|Our tale begins here many years later... for it is through the son of Trevor Belmont that the deeds and courage of the father can be revealed and the tragic fate of the Belmont clan laid bare...

SLATE_TREVOR_3##30 years before
KNIGHT001##It was the elderly, then the men, women and children, until there was not a single person left standing.||Not long after, the tombstones began to move.||Neither the hard oak wood, nor the heavy stones of their graves could prevent the return of the dead to the world of the living.
KNIGHT002##As we crossed the bridge, the chain mechanism began to turn, quickly withdrawing the platform we were standing on.||Luckily I had the reflexes to jump back in time and watched, as the rest of my company tumbled into the abyss.
KNIGHT003##I realized too late that I needed a Combat Cross to reach that platform.||Now, with my back broken from the fall, all I can do is await death.||My corpse will serve as a warning for others, do not enter this evil place without the right equipment.
KNIGHT004##Centuries ago, pilgrims created this underground route to worship the spirit of a woman who it was claimed had the power of healing.||The tunnels they traveled through seeking health and good fortune now seemed to be the only access into the castle.
KNIGHT005##Who could have installed such a strange device in this cave, so far from civilization?||Such an act of witchcraft proves that this ground is unholy.||I swear that the person responsible will pay for this sacrilege, even if it costs me my life.
KNIGHT006##A dozen Mermen suddenly came out of the water and massacred my entire company.||Terrified, I could only watch as they tossed the crippled bodies of my comrades into the water, where still alive, they suffered in agony as their offspring fed on them...
KNIGHT007##Thousands of corpses of men, women and children that were thrown into the moat during the first war have infected the underground streams.||The rivers that flow under the castle are now a death trap, capable of dissolving flesh, bone and the very soul within.
KNIGHT008##In the Eastern part of the cave, I have seen creatures transporting a sacred chest.||After such a long journey, the cloudy water filtering through the rock does not look so unpleasant now.||Before continuing on my way, I will drink a little to regain my strength.
KNIGHT009##The impact of the fall made me lose consciousness for a time.||When I awoke, fear left me breathless, not because of my shattered body but because of the sea of corpses I found myself lying amongst.||I managed to drag myself out of that hell, but realized that some of the corpses had begun to stir... Dear God protect me!
KNIGHT010##As I entered the main hall, the lights flickered for a moment, distorting the shadows and revealing dozens of eerie skulls before me.||From within their empty sockets, eyes seemed to be watching me, waiting for something...||The lights flicker again and my fears are realized: the skulls now lie ever closer.||A sharp whistle comes from the end of the corridor, the lights go out, is this the end?
KNIGHT011##Behind this door lies the great animated chessboard, designed by vampires to kill time during their long nights.||It is said that a human is invited to play from time to time.||If he wins, he is received into the vampire clan.||If he loses, he is included on the dinner menu.
KNIGHT012##An enormous structure has collapsed on top of me.||Now I will never return home or know love from another.||I will die here, though my heart is filled with pride at having served the holy cause, my poor soul yearns for release.
KNIGHT013##They told us to carry these magical scrolls with us at all times and to never part with them.||It would seem that they are able to reflect our thoughts onto the very paper itself.||If we die, they enable other brothers to learn from our mistakes, so that they may complete their mission successfully.
KNIGHT014##Crossing the bridge, we were careful not to trip over the piles of bones stacked upon the ground, when suddenly one of our men shouted out in pain.||His chest had been pierced by the rusted sword of a skeleton.||In a heartbeat, the dead rose up around us, forming an army of fearsome fleshless corpses...
KNIGHT015##According to legend, Michael Gelhart Schneider, a most noble knight and highly skilled archer was captured by the Bernhard's and imprisoned somewhere in the castle.||He died here but vowed vengeance on the castle and its occupants.||It is said, his spirit will come to the aid of a true warrior...alas, I have not seen it.
KNIGHT016##I was never an outstanding soldier.||I was neither strong as my parents expected or brave as my comrades hoped.||I abandoned them in their final battle.||I'm sure none of them will shed a tear for this coward bereft of honor or courage.
KNIGHT017##My God, protect me from these creatures of the devil. Free me from their claws, save me from their voracious appetite and hide me from their eyes, red as fire, thirsty for my blood. Lord protect me!
KNIGHT018##I found a note with the following instructions:||"The worst prisoners must be isolated from the rest and taken to cells with the levers inside.|The mechanisms once activated allow water into the gallery, drowning all of the convicts in the lower sections".||I wonder at the cruelty of this place and feel the last remnants of any hope leave my soul.
KNIGHT019##I will die in this cell tonight.||I will end my life with one final act of cowardice, with great shame in my heart, I shall take my own life.||I refuse to watch the beasts remove the flesh from my bones.||I will deny them my screams.
KNIGHT020##Waking in this dark place, I found a plate of roast meat and a glass of spiced wine beside me.||I prayed that my brothers would rescue me soon.||Ravaged by hunger, I grabbed the juicy leg, took a bite, chewed and swallowed hard.||I hadn't taken more than two bites when I discovered, to my horror, that the bone holding the meat was a human femur.
KNIGHT021##I found puppets seated around a table, their wooden bodies positioned in a way that suggested they were enjoying a great banquet.||I approached and noticed the table filled with all kinds of delicious foods, and reached out to grab a shiny apple.||Its texture felt odd to me, but it was not until I picked it up that I realised it was fake.||A trick to attract my attention, but now it is too late... they are here!
KNIGHT022##A trail of ectoplasm led me to discover the location of a strange translucent creature.||When I stabbed its insubstantial body with my sword, I felt a strange shiver pass through me.||My hands were shrivelled, my legs could hardly hold me up and my hair turned ghostly white.
KNIGHT023##The tomes seem to have been marked by some mad scholar.||They may hide a great secret, or perhaps are just the mad ravings of the insane.||I wish I had enough time to decipher the message but alas time is not on my side.
KNIGHT024##I have found a book with the following passage inscribed within:||"When a great darkness loomed over the castle, a group of wise men schooled in arcane magic took shelter in the library.|As the days went by, their minds were poisoned by envy, arrogance and hatred for each other.|Forbidden rituals were performed but the souls of the men were lost within the pages of the books forever".
KNIGHT025##Rinaldo Gandolfi decided to install retractable spurs on the end of the Combat Cross.||The theory is simple: Brotherhood Knights chosen from amongst the elite could reach places inaccessible to others and thus, pose more of a threat to the evils of the Castle.||Alas even Gandolfi himself is lost to us now.
KNIGHT026##Those little hunchbacks seem intent in their work to build and expand the castle.||I don't know where they come from or what drives them, but for some strange reason they seem to be influenced by the darkness that surrounds the new lord of the castle.
KNIGHT027##As soon as I entered the great hall, I felt drawn to the mysterious mirror in the centre.||The world reflected in it trembled with every step I took until it disappeared completely.||I saw a terrible vision of a pale man, kneeling beside my corpse, examining the last entry on my scroll.
KNIGHT028##The gargoyles leapt from the columns and landed by my side with a look of curiosity.||I began to get rid of my belongings, in the hope of distracting them.||First they chewed with pleasure on my sword, then my boots, my helmet and finally a dagger.||But what fascinated them was the taste of my magic medallion which is now lost to me.
KNIGHT029##The large bell, located atop the clock tower, was once used both to indicate the time and to send warnings to the inhabitants of the castle of imminent attacks.||I pray that the day comes in which its throng is heard again, as a sign of victory of light over darkness...
KNIGHT030##Water began to rush into the cave before I could take off the heavy armor I was wearing.||I held my breath and swam with all my might to the surface pulling off the many pieces of metal that protected me as fast as I could muster. But alas, the faces of my wife and children haunt me as the darkness surrounds me...too late.
KNIGHT031##Scattered throughout the castle, I've noticed strange doors adorned with the shape of a beast.||Based on my research, these seals seem to have been installed to limit access for the weaker creatures to certain parts of the castle.||I wish I had the strength to break them and discover the secrets hidden on the other side.
KNIGHT032##When we arrived upon the shore, it became necessary to build a small raft to reach the other side.||We used our armor as improvised oars until the water monsters snatched them away from us.||We had but one option left: get rid of our weapons and try to swim to the shore, in the hope that some would survive.
KNIGHT033##The terrible state of the pipes down here would perturb even my brother Mario.||Some parts have rusted terribly, while others are covered with fungus due to the high humidity.||Not all the mushrooms look good to eat either, who knows what might happen if I eat one?
KNIGHT034##The wolves fell upon me with savagery, throwing me violently to the ground.||One of them squeezed my neck in its jaws, somehow without breaking it, as if it wanted to force me to watch as the rest devoured my entrails.||I feel each bite rip away part of my flesh... my strength... my faith...
KNIGHT035##The wound is growing worse and the infection is spreading.||I feel too weak to fight and cannot recharge my magic medallion.||All I can do now is sit and pray that my soul will join those of the rest of my comrades quickly...
KNIGHT036##A mysterious voice invited me to sit down. I had a perfect front row seat.||The show began with a procession of wooden figures depicting the sad tale of the Toy Maker.||The show ended and the curtain closed. I applauded, lost in thought and without realizing that beside me sat dozens of these puppets, all applauding along with me.
KNIGHT037##Amongst all the other puppets, I have discovered one that is different from the rest.||It looks like a young boy, around eight years old, who spends the day playing hide-and-seek, like my dearly departed son Edward.||Its gestures remind me a lot of him; it even whistles his favourite songs...|...Edward, is that you?
KNIGHT038##I have studied the puppet manufacturing process carefully.||First they cut the wood and then they polish them, connecting them together with iron nails.||Then they add a coat of paint and assemble the blades.||Finally, a human soul is introduced and a spell cast upon them.||Magical strings control their will and then the procedure is complete.
KNIGHT039##The electricity traps that protect the clock are just too fast for me.||If only I could stop time then I would be able to climb to the top without hindrance.||Simple really... but mastery of time is a fools hope in this dark and evil domain.
KNIGHT040##The abominable corpses that are preserved inside these tanks of formalin seem to be the product of a cross between werewolves, vampires, and humans, in different states of gestation.||What diabolic experiments were they doing in this place? It's true what they say, Frankenstein's mark is upon this place forever!
KNIGHT041##Under my feet lies the Toy Maker's main workshop.||He works without rest, moving from place to place, fixing puppets, mixing potions and drawing magic seals and wards.||When he finishes one of his creations, he usually lets out a deep evil laugh.||It makes my hair stand on end!
KNIGHT042##This infernal machine has already taken the lives of too many of my comrades.||I must find a way to deactivate it as soon as possible or face the same fate.||Someone is coming!
KNIGHT043##I've seen an enormous beast carrying several human bodies.||I hear their cries echoing in the dark.|They howl in pain, begging for mercy and some pray for their souls.||Then, silence.||It must do something supernatural with their bodies...|removing their souls so that the Toy Maker can use them for his new puppets...
KNIGHT044##They came through the windows like black mist, carrying women under their dark wings.||Those who were unconscious were laid on the table, while the rest toyed with those who tried to escape.||The game was a depraved version of hide-and-seek that always ended the same way: the girl's throats open and their captors enjoying their blood.
KNIGHT045##I've come too far to give up now.||I must find the orbs that Dracul created with his blood, only then can I break the dragon seal and face him once and for all.||Entrusted to their fellow vampires, the magic spheres must be kept hidden somewhere in this tower, under the watchful eye of the guards.
KNIGHT046##A ghost floated in the air and then suddenly went inside the enormous armor.||I raised my shield with all my might as a huge mace crashed down upon me.||My arm shattered as I received the first blow.||With the second, my shield was gone.||God knows I won't withstand a third...
KNIGHT047##Damn the beasts that have desecrated the sanctity of this church.||Not satisfied with destroying the paintings, burning the pews and hacking the statues, they have replaced the figure of the holy cross with a blasphemy.||By my knightly honor, I swear I will rid this place of all evil.
KNIGHT048##Heading into the depths of the crypt, I hear the pitiful sobs of a woman.||Consumed by love for a knight who betrayed the Bernhard family she threw herself into the pit, searching for him.||For centuries her sorrow has echoed off the catacomb walls, under the light of the guardian angel.
KNIGHT049##It is said that the Bernhard's were buried in this crypt together with some of their most prized treasures.||The family's chambers have remained untouched, despite the invasion of monsters, thanks to being sealed with a powerful Shadow magic.
KNIGHT050##There was never any real chance of victory, I know that now.||When the giant hit me with its enormous axe, I was thrown aside like an insect.||I no longer have the strength to fight back, only the hope that whoever reads my final memories will not make the same mistake.||Don't think twice brother, run away!
KNIGHT051##The Bernhard family used to condemn traitors by locking them up inside this pit.||History does not contain testimony of survivors, but only the horrible tortures performed by the lords of the castle.
KNIGHT052##This complex of tunnels does not seem to be the work of human hands, rather that of some large creature.|| Strangely the marks on the wall remind me of an insect hive except that the sheer size means it must be the work of an entire colony of thousands...
KNIGHT053##The plans reveal a kind of emergency mechanism that unlocks the door of what must be the games room at the end of the corridor.||If I could find it, I might be able to see how accurate these old texts really are.
KNIGHT054##What at first seemed to be the work of magic turned out to be a complex mechanism of automatons and magnets, placed carefully beneath the board.||The rules of the macabre game were far different from those of conventional chess, making it clear that they were the product of some twisted imagination.
KNIGHT055##The electric bomb has helped me clear a route through the dungeons but care must be taken - some of the enemies are resistant to its rays.
KNIGHT056##I was supposed to wait here while my comrade conducted a quick reconnaissance on the nearby rooms.||At first we thought that would be a good place to camp, but it's been too long now since we parted company and I fear he has been taken or worse.
KNIGHT057##A creature with a glass mask appeared floating in the air inviting me to discover the secrets of the dark room.||For some reason I knew the end of my story would come within these walls, and yet there seemed nothing I could do to change my destiny.
KNIGHT058##Bad fortune seems to follow my every turn.||Of all the corridors open to me, why did I choose this one?||Instead of salvation I find my death.||Alas it was my last bad choice.
KNIGHT059##Locked in this cell there is no escape for me now.||On the wall are the markings of so many who have suffered the same fate.||Look there, some fellow by the name of Chupacabras....what a strange name for a warrior of the brotherhood!
KNIGHT060##From here there is an intricate complex of underground tunnels flooded completely with water.||Should anyone manage to get through, I beg you search for my comrades and tell them I never learned to swim.||Maybe they will come for me?
KNIGHT061##I've discovered a giant door on the upper floor that should lead to the last relic made by Gandolfi, if the brotherhood texts are true.||However, its great value leads me to believe that obtaining it will not be as easy as it might seem. I wonder what became of Rinaldo?
KNIGHT062##I was attracted by the hypnotic voices echoing through the castle, awakening an uncontrollable carnal lust within me.||Their song fogs my mind, clouds my will and invites me to take part in some forbidden game.||Forgive me, Celia, for I cannot control my actions...
KNIGHT063##On the far Eastern end of the mine there is a river of magma that blocks the way to a sort of ancient pagan temple.||I must find a way to jump far enough to reach the other side and rid the place of evil once and for all.
KNIGHT064##There remains a remote chance that I might actually defeat the dark lord.||The tip of the mythical vampire killer that rid the world of that bitch, Carmilla remains somewhere in the castle.||It is my mission to find it and forge the weapon anew once again.
KNIGHT065##There is nothing left for me to do but to avenge my family, if anyone should read this scroll dropped by the brotherhood, know that I, the great pirate king, swear vengeance upon the dragon.||I will not rest until he is dead and pledge that he will forever curse the name of Danasty.
KNIGHT066##So much sweat and blood spilled to reach this point, all wasted due to a simple mistake.||I understand now! Light does not neutralize light; shadow does not defeat shadow.||Balance between the two is the only thing that can finish off the prince of darkness. Just as the legends foretold!
KNIGHT067##Trapped, I spent my final hours troubled by the dangers awaiting my comrade who I couldn't warn.||I trust his fate will be better than mine.
KNIGHT068##Inside the adjoining room I've found two magic seals with engraved messages:||Left Seal:|Doesn't matter when you ask,|I'll always shelter from the light.||Right Seal:|Doesn't matter which magic you offer,|we'll always unfold a path.
KNIGHT069##In the last three decades, a new shadow has spread, darkening the land.||A huge tower, higher than Carmilla's, proclaims the supremacy of the current Dark Lord.||Brotherhood's soldiers will not rest until this abomination is destroyed along with its current master.
